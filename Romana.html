   <P>The ancient Romans had a rich mythology and, while much of it was derived from their neighbors and predecessors, 
    the Greeks, it still defined the rich history of the Roman people as they eventually grew into an empire. Roman writers 
    such as Ovid and Virgil documented and extended the mythological heritage of the ancient Mediterranean to gives us such long-lasting and iconic 
    figures as Aeneas, Vesta, Janus, and the twin founders of Rome itself, Romulus and Remus.
    </P><br>
    <p>Many early Roman authors wrote on the myths of Rome. Ovid, before his exile by Emperor Augustus, 
        wrote at a critical time in Roman history, politically and culturally. The emperor was 
        hoping to reestablish a connection to the Republic's old religion and a reverence for the gods. 
        Ovid penned several works centering on both Roman myth and religion â€” Metamorphoses and Fasti are two of his best-known works. 
        His stories, while mostly Greek, contained Roman names. In Fasti he portrayed the festivals of the first six months of the old Roman calendar,
         the legends of the gods, and the origin of many of their rituals. While early Roman mythology maintained a deep connection with the city and its rich history, 
         it centered on one specific legend: the birth of its supposed founders: Romulus and Remus.

   <h2>The Basilisk:</h2>
   <p> A serpent-like creature with a deadly gaze and the ability to kill with its venomous breath.
    The basilisk is sometimes referred to as "king" because it has been reputed to have a mitre or crown-shaped 
    crest on its head. Stories of the basilisk show that it is not completely distinguished from the cockatrice. 
    The basilisk is alleged to be hatched by a cockerel from the egg of a serpent or toad (the reverse of the cockatrice, 
    which was hatched from a cockerel's "egg" incubated by a serpent or toad). In Medieval Europe, the description of the 
    creature began taking on features from cockerels. It has a venomous strike, and in some versions of the myth, it has the ability to breathe fire.

<h2>The Strix:</h2> 
<p>A nocturnal bird associated with dark magic and often depicted as a vampiric owl.In the case of Ovid's striges, 
    they threatened to do more harm than that. They were said to disembowel an infant and feed on its blood. 
    Ovid allows the possibilities of the striges being birds of nature, or products of magic, or transformations by witches using magical incantations

<h2>Griffin</h2>
<p>Griffins were mythical creatures with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. 
    They probably originated in Near Eastern art and mythology, though they arrived in Greece at a very early period. According to the Romans, 
    the Griffins lived at the very edge of the world, where they hoarded gold and battled the legendary race of the one-eyed Arimaspians.
