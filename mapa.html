  <h3 id="africa">Grootslang  </h3>
  <p>According to legend, the Grootslang is a primordial creature and as old as the world itself. 
    The tales say that the gods (who were novices at creating things) made a terrible mistake when 
    they created the Grootslang because they gave it enormous strength, cunning, and intellect. 
    Realizing their mistake, the gods split the Grootslang into separate creatures and thus the first elephants
     and the first snakes were created. But one of the original Grootslangs escaped, and from this first Grootslang
      all the others were born. It is said to devour elephants by luring them to its cave, which is known as the 
      "Wonderful Hole" or the "Bottomless Pit." Said cave supposedly connects to the sea, which is about 40 miles away. 
      According to local legend, the cave is full of diamonds. It is also said to live in warm lakes and rivers.

    so far from the island in America, and even coming from countries outside the American continent, such as Spain, the Philippines and Russia</p>

  <h3 id="north_america">Bigfoot</h3>
  <p>Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a primate-like cryptid belonging to
    to the hominid family, which is supposedly usually seen in forests at high altitudes, mainly in the
    Pacific Northwest region of North America.<br>
    Be that as it may, legend says that this animal makes noises similar to those of a bear or perhaps a gorilla,
    and although some 'sightings' have been able to locate him in daylight, generally witnesses
    They agree that they saw him at night. They also talk about the reddish glow of their gaze, similar to that of their eyes.

  <h3 id="antartica">Kraken</h3>
  <p>In the Norse sagas and chronicles of the Middle Ages, a terrifying sea monster the size of an island is mentioned,
    that moved through the seas between Norway and Iceland. The Icelandic saga of Örvar-Oddr, from the 13th century, spoke of the "monster
     largest in the sea", which swallowed "men and ships, and even whales." These intriguing news are taken up in texts
      later, such as the chronicle of the Swede Olaus Magnus, from the 16th century, which described colossal creatures capable of sinking a ship.<br>
      Everything would be lost if it were not for the hero Perseus who, on the back of his winged steed, Pegasus, had to face and defeat the
      Kraken showing him the freshly decapitated head of the gorgon, Medusa, turning the monster into stone and saving him from total
      annihilation of the whole world.
